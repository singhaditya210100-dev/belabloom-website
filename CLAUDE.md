## 🔧 Architectural Decisions
1. **App Router only** — No Pages Router. All routes under `app/`.
2. **Tailwind v4** — Uses `@tailwindcss/postcss`, NOT the old `tailwind.config.js` plugin approach. Import via `@import "tailwindcss"` in `globals.css`.
3. **No external carousel lib yet** — Client logos currently in a static grid. Swiper.js integration is planned.
4. **Static generation** — All pages use default static generation (no `"use client"` unless interactive).
5. **Contact form** — API route at `app/api/contact/route.ts` exists but email service (SendGrid/Resend) is NOT yet wired up.

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues / Watch Out For
- `tailwind.config.ts` exists but Tailwind v4 reads config differently — do not add `content` paths the old v3 way.
- `PostCSS` config is at `postcss.config.js` using `@tailwindcss/postcss`.
- Images in `public/images/` have verbose WhatsApp-style filenames — reference them carefully.
- `wp-download/` HTML files are for content reference only, not served.

## 📋 How to Run

npm run type-check # TypeScript check
npm run lint
```

## 🔁 Session Protocol
At the **start** of every session:
1. Read `CLAUDE.md` (this file) ✅
2. Read `STATUS.md` for latest task state
3. Continue from "Next Immediate Action" in `STATUS.md`

At the **end** of every session (or when approaching token limit):
1. Update `STATUS.md` — mark completed items, update "In Progress", set new "Next Immediate Action"
2. Commit with a meaningful message: `git add -A && git commit -m "feat/fix: description"`
3. Push: `git push origin main`
